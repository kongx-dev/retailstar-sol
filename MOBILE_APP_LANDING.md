# Retailstar Mobile App Landing Page

## Overview

The `RetailstarAppHome` component is a mobile-first landing page designed for retailstar.app â€” a Solana-based digital storefront that sells .sol domains with premade websites. The design features a cyberpunk + streetwear aesthetic with strong visual references to abandoned malls, neon signage, and a mysterious underground vibe.

### ðŸ“± User Experience
- **Waitlist Form**: Email collection with validation and loading states
- **Local Storage**: Remembers if user has already submitted
- **Success State**: Shows confirmation message after submission
- **Desktop Link**: Easy access to the full retailstar.xyz experience

## Customization

### Background Image
To use a custom background image, replace the gradient in the component:
```jsx
style={{
  backgroundImage: 'url("/your-image.png")',
  backgroundSize: "cover",
  backgroundPosition: "center",
  backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat"
}}
```

### Color Scheme
Modify the gradient colors and accent colors in the component and CSS to match your brand.

### Form Integration
Replace the simulated API call with your actual backend endpoint:
```jsx
const response = await fetch('/api/waitlist', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email })
});
```

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for background images
- Optimized animations for mobile devices
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
