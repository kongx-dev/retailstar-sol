In a forgotten alley of the Solana subnet, the Rack flickered to life. It didn't ask questions. It didn't validate wallets. It simply *was* — a cracked vending machine stacked with meme-tier domains and corrupted PNGs. No metadata. No promises. Just vibes and terminal static.

Early adopters called themselves **bin snipers**. They bought for 0.1 SOL. Sometimes less. They didn't know why — they just *needed* that JPEG.

And then something changed.`,

Rumors spread that certain domains, when clicked or held, *gave tickets*. An Easter Egg behind the vending machine. A blinking LED in \`/boilerroom\`. RTs became the mall's underground currency.

1 RT could buy you a respin on the Slot Machine. 5 RTs could buy you access to the vault.

Every .2 SOL spent fed the machine.`,

It gated.

A chrome door appeared at the front of Retailstar Mall. It scanned wallets. Only those with RTs, vault domains, or valid Retailpunk tier could enter.

Inside? Vault-only drops. Slot Machines. Flash sales. Hoodies-only dojo rooms. A place where knowledge of lore, not just SOL, gave you edge.`,

- **Retailpunks**: the bin snipers who never left
- **Mallrats**: active mall wanderers, always clicking
- **Slotlords**: the risk-takers, armed with Retail Tickets and nothing to lose
- **Hoodieguards**: domain whales guarding the secret paths
- **Backdoor Dealers**: those who cracked the vending machine's final cipher

Each with their perks. Each with secrets.`,

The mall remains gated.

Early users called it the "meme zone" because that's exactly what it was. No fancy builds, no promises of utility. Just domains with upgraded PFPs, corrupted PNGs, and the occasional hidden gem.

The Rack operated on simple rules:
- Pay what you can afford
- No questions asked
- Everything is temporary
- Vibes over utility

It was chaos, but it was *their* chaos.`,

Until someone figured out they could be spent.

1 RT = One respin on the Slot Machine
5 RTs = Access to the vault
10 RTs = A chance at the hoodie-only dojo

The economy was simple: spend SOL to earn RTs, spend RTs to access better content. But the real genius was that RTs couldn't be bought directly — they had to be earned through engagement.

Every .2 SOL spent on domains fed the machine. Every click, every visit, every share generated RTs. It was the perfect engagement loop.`,

    content: `The transformation from Scav Rack to Retailstar Mall wasn't planned — it was organic. As more users discovered the Rack, as more domains were listed, as more lore was written, the space evolved.

The chrome door appeared one day, and with it came structure:
- **Gating**: Only those with RTs or vault domains could enter
- **Tiers**: Different access levels based on engagement
- **Lore**: Stories that gave context to every domain
- **Community**: Factions that formed around different interests

The mall became more than a marketplace — it became a universe. Each domain was a storefront, each wiki page was a story, each faction had its own secrets.

The Rack was still there, but now it was just one part of something much bigger.`,
